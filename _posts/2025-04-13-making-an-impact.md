I, like countless others have thought about what, if any, positive impact I could make in the world. While I do feel some degree of satisfaction in the charitable plan my husband and I have for after we pass, making an active effort, in my own lifetime, has always been an aspirational goal.

What sort of impact though could be achievable though, without huge swathes of money or a brilliant world changing idea ? Maybe it's  enough to atleast give it an honest try ? "Positive impact" is a pretty loaded term, but maybe it doesn't have to be. In my capacity as a software engineer, maybe there is already some positive impact that I'm minisculely responsible for causing. 

I was recently in Seattle for a work trip and hailed a Lyft for the 8 minute ride to my company's downtown office on one of those rainy days in Seattle. I got into the car and was warmly greeted by the Lyft driver. He was an African American man, in his 50's from what I could gauge and wearing a Stanford sweatshirt. I smiled, optimistically hoping he had a son or daughter at the university. He didn't keep me guessing for long, as he quickly opened up to share he had a son studying at Stanford, 2nd year engineering in Computer Science, once he heard I'm from the Bay Area. He went on to describe how a poor immigrant like him from Ethiopia had left everything behind to pursue a life in America. He spoke about his life hustle, over 30 years spent as a driver since he did not possess any other employable skills. I grew more curious about how he managed to send his son to Stanford, with it's annual fee of over a $100K dollars. He happily informed me that his son was set up well due to his schooling in one of the most sought after private schools in Seattle, filled with children of tech CEO's such as Bill Gates. He mentioned he was a plain yellow taxi cab driver when his son was able to secure a scholarship for the private school. He described how his son felt embarrassment when he would be dropped off to school in a cab. That's what forced him to pivot to looking at driving for Lyft as a option instead. He agreed to work harder, to be able to afford a car of his own that he could drop off his son in, in exchange for his son promising to beat everyone else in his class. "We both kept our promises", he said, "that's how he ended up in Stanford, on a scholarship as well".

My heart was swelling and I couldn't help but leave with a huge smile on my face as he dropped me off outside the Lyft office on 83 S King Street, where I worked.
